<!-- 
This HTML file demonstrates the recommended structure for writing HTML code. 
The structure includes the following key components:

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**: Specifies the version of HTML being used. 
    In this case, it indicates the current version of HTML (HTML5).

2. **HTML Tag**: Wraps the entire application and includes a `lang` attribute 
    to specify the language of the document (e.g., "en" for English).

3. **Head Section**: Contains metadata and additional resources for the document. 
    - Includes a `<title>` tag to define the title displayed in the browser's title bar.

4. **Body Section**: Contains the visible content of the webpage. 
    - Includes an `<h1>` tag to display a heading.
    - Additional tags like `<footer>` can be used to include information such as copyright or links.

5. **Tags Overview**:
    - Tags can be self-closing (e.g., `<input>`) or non-self-closing (e.g., `<h1>` with opening and closing tags).
    - Content visible to the user is placed within the body tag.

6. **Shorthand Syntax**: Tools like Emmet can be used to auto-generate the basic HTML structure, 
    but for learning purposes, the structure is written manually here.

This file serves as a foundational example for understanding the structure of HTML documents 
and will be expanded upon to explore various HTML tags and their functionalities.
