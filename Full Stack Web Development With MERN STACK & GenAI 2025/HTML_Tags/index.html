<!-- 
This HTML file demonstrates the recommended structure for writing HTML code. 
The structure includes the following key components:

1. **DOCTYPE Declaration**: Specifies the version of HTML being used. 
    In this case, it indicates the current version of HTML (HTML5).

2. **HTML Tag**: Wraps the entire application and includes a `lang` attribute 
    to specify the language of the document (e.g., "en" for English).

3. **Head Section**: Contains metadata and additional resources for the document. 
    - Includes a `<title>` tag to define the title displayed in the browser's title bar.

4. **Body Section**: Contains the visible content of the webpage. 
    - Includes an `<h1>` tag to display a heading.
    - Additional tags like `<footer>` can be used to include information such as copyright or links.

5. **Tags Overview**:
    - Tags can be self-closing (e.g., `<input>`) or non-self-closing (e.g., `<h1>` with opening and closing tags).
    - Content visible to the user is placed within the body tag.

6. **Shorthand Syntax**: Tools like Emmet can be used to auto-generate the basic HTML structure, 
    but for learning purposes, the structure is written manually here.

This file serves as a foundational example for understanding the structure of HTML documents 
and will be expanded upon to explore various HTML tags and their functionalities.

HTML tags are fundamental building blocks of web pages, used to define the structure and content. 
Tags can create elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. 

Each tag typically consists of an opening tag and a closing tag, with the opening tag optionally 
containing attributes. Attributes modify the behavior or appearance of the tag, similar to how 
different styles or accessories enhance a person's appearance. For example, attributes can change 
the color or size of an element.

There are two main types of tags:
1. Non-Self-Closing Tags: These tags have both an opening tag and a closing tag. The content 
    between these tags is what gets displayed on the web page. Attributes can be added to the 
    opening tag to modify its behavior or appearance.
    Example: <h1>Heading</h1>

2. Self-Closing Tags: These tags do not have a closing tag. Instead, they close themselves 
    within the opening tag. Attributes can also be added to self-closing tags.
    Example: <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description" />

In summary, an HTML element consists of the tag, its attributes (if any), and the content 
it encloses (for non-self-closing tags). Tags instruct the browser on how to render the content 
on the page.

The next step is to explore common HTML tags and their usage.
